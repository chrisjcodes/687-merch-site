## Change Management

### Database Migration Strategy
- Comprehensive backup before each phase
- Incremental migrations with rollback capability
- Data validation at each step
- No breaking changes during active development

### Feature Flag System
Features will be built with configuration flags to enable smooth transition:
```typescript
interface BusinessConfig {
  features: {
    employeeManagement: boolean;
    materialTracking: boolean;
    advancedReporting: boolean;
    vendorIntegrations: boolean;
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Review Phase 1 Plan**: Start with [Phase 1 documentation](./phase-1-business-mvp.md)
2. **Database Backup**: Create full backup before schema changes
3. **Feature Branch**: Create `feature/phase-1-business-mvp` branch
4. **Track Progress**: Use todo system to monitor implementation progress

## Documentation Standards

Each phase document should include:
- **Overview**: What this phase accomplishes
- **Technical Requirements**: Database changes, new models, API updates
- **User Interface Changes**: New screens, modified workflows
- **Testing Criteria**: How to validate successful implementation
- **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if issues arise
- **Migration Notes**: Data migration requirements and scripts

This structured approach ensures we deliver immediate value to the 687 Merch business while building a solid foundation for the future configurable product offering.
